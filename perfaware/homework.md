### Part One

* [@cmuratori](https://github.com/cmuratori) - Reference 8086 decoder and cycle count estimator ([github](https://github.com/cmuratori/computer_enhance/tree/main/perfaware/sim86))
* Seth ([github](https://github.com/SethArchambault/Performance-Aware-Programming))
* [@jeng](https://github.com/jeng) - ImGui version with debugging features ([codeberg](https://codeberg.org/jeng/Sim8088)) ([youtube](https://youtu.be/KOn6WozGtVk))
* Gaurav Gautam [Webassembly](https://github.com/gautam1168/gautam1168.github.io/tree/main/Part10-8086) - Homeworks done using the reference decoder. The code in this repository uses the webassembly contrib in the main repo. However, there is a bit more C++ code on top of what exits in the contrib folder in the main repository. This can be found in my [fork](https://github.com/gautam1168/computer_enhance/tree/simulatorbuild). The [live page](https://gautam1168.github.io/Part10-8086/index.html) shows the working homeworks.

* [@kiroxas](https://github.com/kiroxas) - ([Github](https://github.com/kiroxas/ComputerEnhance/tree/main)) ([Youtube](https://youtu.be/-OW_lgkXy2k))
* [@santiagocabrera96](https://github.com/santiagocabrera96) - [Solution in Clojure](https://github.com/santiagocabrera96/computer-enhance)
* [@PinataMostGrim](https://github.com/PinataMostGrim) - [Solution in C](https://github.com/PinataMostGrim/perfaware)
* [@ethanfischer](https://github.com/ethanfischer) ([homework in C#](https://github.com/ethanfischer/computer_enhance))
* [@Said6289](https://github.com/Said6289) - [Solution to listings 37 - 40 in x64 assembly](https://github.com/Said6289/perf_aware_course/tree/main/instruction_decode). This was my first attempt to write something more substantial in assembly. It was very time-consuming and so I only did the first few assignments.
* [@charlesastaylor](https://github.com/charlesastaylor) - Snake game in 8086 assembly ([gist](https://gist.github.com/charlesastaylor/18c7c8005fed9d0af1a3ee2b24fcd724)) ([youtube](https://youtu.be/s_S4-QHeFMc))
* [@bitwitch](https://github.com/bitwitch) - 8086 simulator in C ([github](https://github.com/bitwitch/perfaware))
